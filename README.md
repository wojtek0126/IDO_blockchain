# IDO_blockchain
Task time! IDO section for blockchain web app.
It will use react, ts, storybook and material-ui. I cannot do it in target repo - slow internet and error spree. Deadline is coming. What will I do? Create own environment with same libs as required, mimic original file structure, copy styles and create desired component, then copy it to target repo and pull request without testing in target env. and hopefully there team will be happy. Risky but nothing to lose. Otherwise stuck in the mud with time ticking and nothing done. Let's freakin go!!!
